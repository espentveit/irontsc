# Introduction
This document specifies the Remote Desktop Protocol: Multitransport Extension to Remote Desktop Protocol: Basic Connectivity and Graphics Remoting, as specified in [MS-RDPBCGR] section 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. This protocol is used to implement multiple transport connections between a Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) client and server.
Sections 1.5, 1.8, 1.9, 2, and 3 of this specification are normative. All other sections and examples in this specification are informative.
## Glossary
This document uses the following terms:
cookie: A randomly generated, 16-byte sequence that is used to authenticate the client to the server during the creation of a multitransport connection.
message mode: A named pipe can be of two types: byte mode or message mode. In byte mode, the data sent or received on the named pipe does not have message boundaries but is treated as a continuous Stream. In message mode, message boundaries are enforced.
protocol data unit (PDU): Information that is delivered as a unit among peer entities of a network and that can contain control information, address information, or data. For more information on remote procedure call (RPC)-specific PDUs, see [C706] section 12.
Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP): A multi-channel protocol that allows a user to connect to a computer running Microsoft Terminal Services (TS). RDP enables the exchange of client and server settings and also enables negotiation of common settings to use for the duration of the connection, so that input, graphics, and other data can be exchanged and processed between client and server.
Transmission Control Protocol (TCP): A protocol used with the Internet Protocol (IP) to send data in the form of message units between computers over the Internet. TCP handles keeping track of the individual units of data (called packets) that a message is divided into for efficient routing through the Internet.
MAY, SHOULD, MUST, SHOULD NOT, MUST NOT: These terms (in all caps) are used as defined in [RFC2119]. All statements of optional behavior use either MAY, SHOULD, or SHOULD NOT.

## Overview
The Remote Desktop Protocol: Multitransport Extension enables multiple side-band channels (also referred to as "multitransport connections") between an RDP client and server over different underlying transport protocols such as reliable UDP, or lossy UDP ([MS-RDPEUDP] section 1.3.1). Each multitransport connection leverages the strengths of the underlying transport protocol to efficiently deliver different types of RDP content, thereby improving the user's experience, especially on WAN or wireless networks.
After the main RDP connection has been established and secured, the server can initiate multitransport connections if it is determined that the connection would benefit from additional transports. Each multitransport connection that is initiated is bootstrapped with data that is exchanged on the main RDP connection by using the server-to-client Initiate Multitransport Request PDU ([MS-RDPBCGR] section 2.2.15.1) sent during the RDP connection sequence ([MS-RDPBCGR] section 1.3.1.1).
The Initiate Multitransport Request PDU contains information that uniquely identifies the multitransport connection; it contains a request ID, a cookie, and a protocol identifier that identifies the type of multitransport connection that the client attempts to establish. When the client receives the Initiate Multitransport Request PDU, it attempts to establish a secure multitransport connection with the server.
All multitransport connections are secured by using either Transport Layer Security (TLS) ([RFC2246], [RFC4346] and [RFC5246]) or Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) ([RFC4347]). TLS is used to secure transport connections that ensure the reliable delivery of data, while DTLS is used to secure transport connections that can potentially lose data. If the creation of the underlying transport connection is successful and the TLS or DTLS handshake succeeds, then the multitransport connection is used to transport selected dynamic virtual channel traffic.
### Messages and Intersection with Other Protocols
Bootstrapping, creating, securing and finalizing a multitransport connection uses messages from a number of protocols. The following sequence diagram presents an overview of these messages and protocols.
# RDP Multitransport Protocol Sequence Diagram

This diagram illustrates the sequence of messages exchanged between a Client and a Server during the establishment and use of a multitransport tunnel in the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP).

## Participants

- **Client**: Initiates the connection and receives responses.
- **Server**: Responds to client requests and manages the tunnel.

## Message Sequence

The sequence of events is as follows:

1.  **Initiate Multitransport Request PDU**
    - Direction: Server → Client
    - Protocol: MS-RDPBCGR

2.  **(Ellipsis) ...**
    - Indicates intermediate steps or messages not shown in detail.

3.  **UDP Connection Initiation (UDP-R or UDP-L)**
    - Direction: Server → Client
    - Protocol: MS-RDPEUDP

4.  **Security Layer Handshake (TLS or DTLS)**
    - Direction: Server → Client
    - Protocol: RFC 2246, 4346, 5246 or 4347

5.  **Tunnel Create Request PDU**
    - Direction: Client → Server
    - Protocol: MS-RDPEMT

6.  **Tunnel Create Response PDU**
    - Direction: Server → Client
    - Protocol: MS-RDPEMT

7.  **Initiate Multitransport Response PDU**
    - Direction: Client → Server
    - Protocol: MS-RDPBCGR

8.  **Tunnel Data PDUs**
    - Direction: Server → Client
    - Protocol: MS-RDPEMT

## Protocol Mapping

The diagram maps each message type to its corresponding RDP protocol component:

| Message Type | Direction | Protocol |
|--------------|-----------|----------|
| Initiate Multitransport Request PDU | Server → Client | MS-RDPBCGR |
| UDP Connection Initiation (UDP-R or UDP-L) | Server → Client | MS-RDPEUDP |
| Security Layer Handshake (TLS or DTLS) | Server → Client | RFC 2246, 4346, 5246 or 4347 |
| Tunnel Create Request PDU | Client → Server | MS-RDPEMT |
| Tunnel Create Response PDU | Server → Client | MS-RDPEMT |
| Initiate Multitransport Response PDU | Client → Server |

![Messages used by multitransport connections](images/MS-RDPEMT-240423_image1.png)
Figure 1: Messages used by multitransport connections
The RDP server initiates a multitransport connection by sending an Initiate Multitransport Request PDU ([MS-RDPBCGR] section 2.2.15.1) to the RDP client over the main RDP connection. Upon receiving the Initiate Multitransport Request PDU the client initiates the creation of the requested transport (reliable or lossy UDP) as described in [MS-RDPEUDP] sections 1.3.2 and 1.3.2.1.
After the transport has been successfully set up, the connection is secured by using Transport Layer Security (TLS) or Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) to set up a secure channel. TLS ([RFC2246], [RFC4346] and [RFC5246]) is used to secure reliable UDP transport connections, while DTLS ([RFC4347]) is used to secure lossy UDP transport connections.
Once the secure channel has been established, the client finalizes the creation of the multitransport connection by sending a request ID and a security cookie to the server in the Tunnel Create Request PDU (section 2.2.2.1); this PDU is sent over the newly created and secured multitransport connection. The data sent in the Tunnel Create Request PDU has to be identical to the data that the client received over the main RDP connection as part of the Initiate Multitransport Request PDU. The server compares the data in the Tunnel Create Request PDU to the data that was sent over the main RDP connection in the Initiate Multitransport Request PDU. This comparison allows the server to match the incoming multitransport connection request to an existing main RDP connection and to authenticate the connection based on the security cookie. If the security check succeeds, the server indicates to the client that it was able to successfully initialize the multitransport connection by sending the Tunnel Create Response PDU (section 2.2.2.2) over the multitransport connection. The server and client can then start transferring data over the multitransport connection.
If Soft-Sync ([MS-RDPEDYC] section 3.1.5.3) is supported by the server and client, the Initiate Multitransport Response PDU ([MS-RDPBCGR] section 2.2.15.2) is sent to the server after each transport is created, and the multitransport connections are not used to send or receive dynamic virtual channel data until Soft-Sync negotiation is completed.
All data is transferred over the multitransport connection in message mode. The Tunnel PDU Header (section 2.2.1.1) includes the size of the message that the multitransport protocol data unit (PDU) contains; the client assembles the entire message before delivering it to the upper layers.
### RDP Channels and Multitransport Connections
The main RDP connection is encapsulated in the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) ([MS-RDPBCGR] section 2.1). The I/O channel ([MS-RDPBCGR] section 3.2.1.3 and 3.3.1.3) and the optional message channel ([MS-RDPBCGR] sections 3.2.1.3 and 3.3.1.5) are encapsulated within the main RDP connection and are used to transport core RDP PDUs, input and graphics data. In addition to these two channels there is a collection of negotiated static virtual channels ([MS-RDPBCGR] section 1.3.3). One of these static virtual channels, named "DRDYNVC", multiplexes a collection of dynamic virtual channels ([MS-RDPEDYC] sections 1, 2 and 3).
Multitransport connections run over a separate transport protocol to the main RDP connection and multiplex a collection of selected dynamic virtual channels.
The following figure illustrates the hierarchy and encapsulation of RDP channels and transports.
# RDP Connection Architecture Diagram

This diagram illustrates the layered architecture of a Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) connection between an RDP Client and an RDP Server. The connection is organized into multiple channels and transport connections, with distinct layers for different types of data and communication.

## Main RDP Connection

The top-level connection is labeled "Main RDP Connection:" and contains the following components, stacked vertically from top to bottom:

- **I/O Channel**
- **Message Channel**
- **Static Virtual Channel #S₁**
- **Static Virtual Channel #S₂**
- ...
- **Static Virtual Channel #Sₘ**
- **Dynamic Virtual Channels ("DRDYNC" Static Virtual Channel):**
  - **Dynamic Virtual Channel #D₁**
  - **Dynamic Virtual Channel #D₂**
  - ...
  - **Dynamic Virtual Channel #Dₙ**

## Multitransport Connections

Below the dynamic virtual channels, the diagram shows two separate multitransport connections, each with its own set of dynamic virtual channels:

### Multitransport Connection #1 (Reliable UDP)

- **Dynamic Virtual Channel #R₁**
- **Dynamic Virtual Channel #R₂**
- ...
- **Dynamic Virtual Channel #Rₚ**

### Multitransport Connection #2 (Lossy UDP)

- **Dynamic Virtual Channel #L₁**
- **Dynamic Virtual Channel #L₂**
- ...
- **Dynamic Virtual Channel #Lq**

## Structure and Layout

The diagram is organized as a vertical stack, with the RDP Client on the left side and the RDP Server on the right side. Each layer or channel is represented as a horizontal band. The gray bands appear to serve as separators or headers for major sections.

## Key Components

- **RDP Client**: The client-side entity initiating the connection.
- **RDP Server**: The server-side entity receiving the connection.
- **Static Virtual Channels**: Predefined channels (S₁ to Sₘ) that are established at connection time.
- **Dynamic Virtual Channels**: Channels (D₁ to Dₙ, R₁ to Rₚ, L₁ to Lq) that can be created dynamically during the session.
- **Multitransport Connections**: Two distinct transport layers for different types of data:
  - **Reliable UDP**: For data requiring reliability.
  - **Lossy UDP**: For data that can tolerate packet loss.

## Relationships

The diagram shows a clear hierarchical and layered structure where:

- The Main RDP Connection

Figure 2: RDP channels and transport
### Connection Termination
There is no explicit connection-termination protocol over a multitransport connection. The client and server terminate the multitransport connection and disconnect the underlying transports when the main RDP connection is disconnected by the server or the client.
## Relationship to Other Protocols
The Remote Desktop Protocol: Multitransport Extension operates over the RDP-UDP protocol, as defined in [MS-RDPEUDP] section 1, 2, and 3. Protocol traffic (section 2.2) is secured by using Transport Layer Security (TLS) ([RFC2246], [RFC4346] and [RFC5246]) for reliable RDP-UDP streams and Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) ([RFC4347]) for unreliable (lossy) RDP-UDP streams. The TLS or DTLS handshake, as well as the encrypted payload, are embedded in the RDPUDP_SOURCE_PAYLOAD_HEADER as defined in [MS-RDPEUDP].
A multitransport connection is initiated by an RDP server sending the Initiate Multitransport Request PDU ([MS-RDPBCGR] section 2.2.1.15.1) to an RDP client over the main RDP connection.
## Prerequisites/Preconditions
The multitransport connection must be initiated over the main RDP connection using the Initiate Multitransport Request PDU ([MS-RDPBCGR] section 2.2.1.15.1). The underlying RDP-UDP ([MS-RDPEUDP] section 1, 2, and 3) transport which is created must be secured with Transport Layer Security (TLS) or Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS).<1> Furthermore, the client and server MUST support the Remote Desktop Protocol: Dynamic Channel Virtual Channel Extension (as specified in [MS-RDPEDYC]) and the client MUST advertise support for the "DRDYNVC" static channel in the Client Network Data block ([MS-RDPBCGR] section 2.2.1.3.4) sent in the MCS Connect Initial PDU with GCC Conference Create Request ([MS-RDPBCGR] section 2.2.1.3).
## Applicability Statement
The Remote Desktop Protocol: Multitransport Extension is applicable in scenarios where multiple side-band channels over different underlying transport protocols are required between an RDP client and server.
## Versioning and Capability Negotiation
Support for multitransport in the Remote Desktop Protocol: Multitransport Extension is advertised by the client using the Client Multitransport Channel Data ([MS-RDPBCGR] section 2.2.1.3.8), while the server advertises support in the Server Multitransport Channel Data ([MS-RDPBCGR] section 2.2.1.4.6).
## Vendor-Extensible Fields
None.
## Standards Assignments
None.
# Messages
## Transport
The Remote Desktop Protocol: Multitransport Extension operates over the RDP-UDP protocol, as defined in [MS-RDPEUDP], sections 1, 2 and 3.
Multitransport connections are bootstrapped using the Initiate Multitransport Request PDU ([MS-RDPBCGR] section 2.2.15.1), which is sent from server to client over the main RDP connection.
## Message Syntax
The following sections define the Remote Desktop Protocol: Multitransport Extension messages that are exchanged between an RDP client and server.
All multiple-byte fields within a message MUST be marshaled in little-endian byte order, unless otherwise specified.
This protocol references commonly used data types as defined in [MS-DTYP].

# Protocol Details
## Common Details
### Abstract Data Model
None.
### Timers
None.
### Initialization
None.
### Higher-Layer Triggered Events
None.
### Message Processing Events and Sequencing Rules
All the PDUs that are sent over the multitransport connection contain an RDP_TUNNEL_HEADER structure (section 2.2.1.1) encapsulated in a mandatory TunnelHeader field.
#### Processing the Action Field of the Tunnel PDU Header
The basic processing of a Tunnel PDU Header (section 2.2.1.1) begins with the reading of the Action field, which determines the type of PDU that MUST be processed. During the connection establishment phase, the client first sends an RDP_TUNNEL_CREATEREQUEST PDU (section 2.2.2.1) over the multitransport connection. This PDU is constructed by using the information sent in the Initiate Multitransport Request PDU ([MS-RDPBCGR] section 2.2.1.15.1) received over the main RDP connection. The PDU has an action code of RDPTUNNEL_ACTION_CREATEREQUEST (0x0), indicating to the server that it MUST process this PDU as a Tunnel Create Request PDU.
The response to this Tunnel Create Request PDU, an RDP_TUNNEL_CREATERESPONSE PDU (section 2.2.2.2), is sent by the server to the client using an action code of RDPTUNNEL_ACTION_CREATERESPONSE (0x1). This action code indicates to the client that the PDU MUST be decoded as a Tunnel Create Response PDU, as defined in section 2.2.2.2.
After the multitransport connection is established, all data transfer from the upper layers is implemented using an action code of RDPTUNNEL_ACTION_DATA (0x2), which indicates to the receiving endpoint that the PDU contains opaque data from upper layers.
#### Processing the PayloadLength Field of the Tunnel PDU Header
The multitransport connection operates in message mode. The PayloadLength field of the RDP_TUNNEL_HEADER structure (section 2.2.1.1) indicates the total number of bytes in the PDU, excluding the length of the RDP_TUNNEL_HEADER structure. The receiving endpoint uses this value to continue reading the incoming byte stream from the lower layer until the total number of bytes read equals the length contained in the PayloadLength field. After the receiver has read the entire PDU, the PDU MUST be delivered to the upper layers.
#### Processing the HeaderLength Field of the Tunnel PDU Header
For the Tunnel Create Request PDU (section 2.2.2.1) and Tunnel Create Response PDU (section 2.2.2.2), the HeaderLength field MUST be 0x04.
For Tunnel Data PDUs (section 2.2.2.3), the HeaderLength field indicates the offset from the beginning of the PDU to where the first byte of the actual payload data begins. The HeaderLength field MUST contain a value that is greater than or equal to the size of the RDP_TUNNEL_HEADER structure (section 2.2.1.1). A field size greater than the size of the RDP_TUNNEL_HEADER structure indicates the presence of one or more RDP_TUNNEL_SUBHEADER structures (section 2.2.1.1.1) in the SubHeaders field.
The multitransport connection tunnel layer provides a provision for subheaders to be embedded within the tunnel layer, thereby enabling client and server extensions of the protocol. Currently, the RDP Network Characteristics Detection structures ([MS-RDPBCGR] section 2.2.14) can be embedded within the Tunnel Header.
Each subheader definition begins with a one byte SubHeaderLength field that indicates the length of the subheader. This field is followed by a one byte SubHeaderType field, which is used as an identifier of the high-level subheader. The data for the subheader itself follows the SubHeaderType field.
#### Processing Tunnel Data PDUs
Tunnel Data PDUs (section 2.2.2.3) are transmitted with the Action field of the embedded RDP_TUNNEL_HEADER structure (section 2.2.1.1) set to RDPTUNNEL_ACTION_DATA (0x3).
The offset, in bytes, to the start of the data payload is stored in the HeaderLength field of the embedded RDP_TUNNEL_HEADER structure, as described in section 3.1.5.3. The total length, in bytes, of the data payload is stored in the PayloadLength field as described in section 3.1.5.2.
#### Sequencing of PDUs on the Multitransport Connection
The Remote Desktop Protocol: Multitransport Extension MUST begin with the RDP_TUNNEL_CREATEREQUEST PDU (section 2.2.2.1), which is sent from the client to the server. The client MUST NOT send any data to the server until it receives the RDP_TUNNEL_CREATERESPONSE_PDU (section 2.2.2.2) with a successful HRESULT code. The server MUST NOT send any data until it has received the RDP_TUNNEL_CREATEREQUEST PDU, processed it, and sent an RDP_TUNNEL_CREATERESPONSE PDU with a successful HRESULT code to the client.
### Timer Events
None.
### Other Local Events
None.
## Server Details
### Abstract Data Model
Connection Store: In order to match incoming multitransport connections to existing main RDP connections, the server maintains a store of outstanding multitransport requests. The store contains the request ID and cookie that the server sent to the client as part of the Initiate Multitransport Request ([MS-RDPBCGR] section 2.2.15.1) and a reference to the main RDP connection that initiated the multitransport request. When an incoming multitransport request is encountered, the server matches the RequestID field and SecurityCookie field presented by the multitransport connection as part of the Tunnel Create Request PDU (section 2.2.2.1) to an outstanding request ID and cookie in the store. If a match is found, the server hands off the incoming multitransport connection to the main RDP connection that requested it, enabling multiple connections between server and client for the same RDP session.
### Timers
None.
### Initialization
None.
### Higher-Layer Triggered Events
None.
### Message Processing Events and Sequencing Rules
#### Processing the RDP_TUNNEL_CREATEREQUEST PDU
The RDP_TUNNEL_CREATEREQUEST PDU (section 2.2.2.1) is used by the server for two purposes. The first purpose is to correlate incoming requests to the existing main RDP connection on the server that originally sent the Initiate Multitransport Request PDU ([MS-RDPBCGR] section 2.2.15.1). The second is a security check that matches the incoming security cookie to the security cookie that was sent over the secured main RDP connection.
The RequestID and SecurityCookie fields of the RDP_TUNNEL_CREATEREQUEST PDU MUST be identical to the corresponding fields in the Initiate MultiTransport Request PDU that was sent from the server to the client over the main RDP connection. These fields are compared to the data stored in the Connection Store abstract data model element (section 3.2.1).
If a match for the RequestID and SecurityCookie pair is found on the server for a pending multitransport request, the server associates the incoming multitransport connection with the existing session and MUST send the client an RDP_TUNNEL_CREATERESPONSE PDU (section 2.2.2.2) with a successful HRESULT code.
If a match is not found, the server can either close the connection to the client or send an RDP_TUNNEL_CREATERESPONSE PDU with an unsuccessful HRESULT code.<3>
### Timer Events
None.
### Other Local Events
None.
## Client Details
### Abstract Data Model
None.
### Timers
None.
### Initialization
None.
### Higher-Layer Triggered Events
None.
### Message Processing Events and Sequencing Rules
#### Processing the RDP_TUNNEL_CREATERESPONSE PDU
The RDP_TUNNEL_CREATERESPONSE PDU (section 2.2.2.2) is sent from the RDP server to the RDP client in response to the RDP_TUNNEL_CREATEREQUEST PDU (section 2.2.2.1). The PDU contains an HRESULT code that indicates whether the server successfully accepted the multitransport connection.
The client MUST disconnect the connection if the RDP_TUNNEL_CREATERESPONSE PDU contains an unsuccessful HRESULT code. If the RDP_TUNNEL_CREATERESPONSE PDU contains a successful HRESULT code, the server has accepted the connection and successfully associated it with an existing RDP session. The client can then start sending data to the server and MUST be ready to receive and process data from the server.
### Timer Events
None.
### Other Local Events
None.

# Security
## Security Considerations for Implementers
The RDP multitransport connections use SSL and DTLS, respectively, for reliable and unreliable UDP transport connections for data encryption and server certificate validation.
The client is authenticated to the server by presenting a security cookie as part of the Tunnel Create Request PDU (section 2.2.2), which the server provided to the client over the secure main RDP connection, as defined in [MS-RDPBCGR].
